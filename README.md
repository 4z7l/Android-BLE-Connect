This is Sample Application to connect between Android and Bluetooth Low Energy Device. I used Service which is Android Component for constant interaction with BLE device.

1. Connect to the paired BLE device

   The wearable device type of this application is preset as **MI Band 2**. You can change device name to test other BLE device in [HERE](https://github.com/4z7l/Android-BLE-Connect/blob/478a7e34848b536700eae9311c761ac1e79ebb28/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/ble/util/BLE.kt#L20).

2. Get the value of wearable device. 

   You can access to **heart rate** through UUID.
